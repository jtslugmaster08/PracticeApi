Adding a practice api, to well practice creating them. Still learning but if you would like to use this as a launching point for you own api. hopefully it helps get you started.

.Net8 RESTful api. with entityframework 8. Dependency injection. NUnit tests. Identity, and JWT bearer tokens for authorization. Change password, change email, forgot password. More as I update the api over time.
